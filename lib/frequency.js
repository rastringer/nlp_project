var string = 'In your book ‘‘The Art of Memoir,’’ you write that one of the side effects of being a memoirist is that strangers ‘‘skip the small talk and confide the most turbulent patches of their lives,’’ which to me wasn’t so surprising, but what you wrote about it was: ‘‘I have never not been moved by such a tale.’’ Small talk is boring. Politics are boring. The weather is boring. The minute somebody says to you, ‘‘I’ve never told anybody this before,’’ they’ve got your attention. I’m not a particularly nice person, but I’ve got to say, it makes me feel less lonely in the world when people confide in me. FROM OUR ADVERTISERS Have you learned anything from the kinds of stories that strangers tell you? Mostly, I learn about how resilient we are. The world breeds monsters, but kindness grows just as wild.You write that a good memoir is not about ego. How so? Obviously, it has to be the most interesting version of you. But it’s not about peddling some highly polished version of yourself to a gullible public. We’ve all read bad novels that are that way. Narcissism is the bacterium infecting all bad writing. You also write that there’s an important difference between lying, which is fairly concrete, and the slipperiness of truth. Do you mean that writers should be allowed to tell the truth just as they see it? Just don’t try to trick people, including yourself. There is a solidity that you feel inside yourself the more truth you unearth. There’s a gap between the public and private selves, and for me, whatever freedom I’ve gained has come from narrowing that gap. It seems there is inherent interest in the memoirs of people who have undergone something horrible. But that’s everybody on the planet. People say that as if it’s somehow unseemly to write about traumatic experiences. Yet, as you point out, memoirs are more popular than ever. We’re crying all the way to the bank.

It’s a list whose virtue is inclusion. How many great novels were there in the 19th century? Everybody will say there were thousands, but there really weren’t. As for the celebrities I included, I think all those people are real writers. It’s not the Real Housewives, you know? Those are all smart people. Lena Dunham went to Oberlin. You started teaching memoir writing 30 years ago. How have the students taking the classes changed? Have you seen the effect of social media? No. Memoirs are not ‘‘Look at my boobs at the party.’’ The ones that I read are works of art meant to last millenniums. I still read St. Augustine. It’s not the difference between apples and oranges, it’s the difference between a sunflower seed and a steak.

Believe it or not, I’m actually not that interested in representation of myself in other people’s writing. I’ve also never Googled myself. It wouldn’t occur to me to do so. It’s the same reason I don’t watch pornography. It’s not that I occupy some moral high ground. I just think: Down that road lies madness. As someone who reveals so much, is there a time that an interviewer has gone too far with you? Oh, yeah, but I have no problem saying, ‘‘I’m not going to discuss that.’’ I would never talk about anybody’s penis. You can ask me about my relationship with David Wallace all you like; I’m not going to talk about his penis. That’s one of the least interesting things about any man, really. If only they knew that.
